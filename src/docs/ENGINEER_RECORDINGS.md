# Engineer Recordings - Draft Scripts

These recordings play during each night, like FNAF phone calls. Engineer is leaving notes for himself, documenting the situation. Each recording is approximately 1 minute when read aloud at a natural pace.

## Night 1 Recording

**Duration:** ~75 seconds  
**Tone:** Cautiously hopeful, establishing the situation

> *[CLICK - tape recorder starts]*
> 
> "Log one. For the time being, Medic and I've hunkered down in Blu's intel, which's been inexplicably abandoned. Blu Team's nowhere to be found. I dunno how long it'll be till we can leave their base. All comms are jammed or down—classic.
> 
> As for the rest of our team... they're not with us. They're not right. They're still in Red Fort, doing God knows what. Except for Scout and Soldier. They made their way across the bridge, and I think they're trying to git to us. Something's happened to them. Something... unexplainable. They're not the same men I work with. At least, not right now.
> 
> Medic's getting some shut-eye. He's determined to get to the bottom of this, and he says he'll need rest. And I trust him with my life... hell, I've easily trusted him with more before. So I've set up my dispenser, sentry, and wrangler for the time being. Should sustain us down here for now. Point and click, like I've always done. Should ward 'em off, but sure as hell won't kill 'em. Thankfully. We don't want 'em dead.
> 
> Just need to last till 6 AM. Then Doc can take over. I hope he can fix the boys... before the boys fix us."
> 
> *[CLICK - tape recorder stops]*

## Night 2 Recording

**Duration:** ~75 seconds  
**Tone:** Growing unease, frustration creeping in

> *[CLICK - tape recorder starts]*
> 
> "Log two. Come sunrise, Scout and Soldier just... stopped. Gave up, and staggered on down back to Red Base, as if it seemingly wasn't worth it to keep trying. Doc's theory is that they need to recharge after sustaining so many rockets to the dome. And I'll happily let them. Give us a window to work, even if it don't sit right with me.
> 
> Doc believes it's some sort of virus. Not quite a zombie virus, but something entirely different. It just so happens that Sniper recently came back from a secret mission the Administrator sent 'im on. My money's there. In order to investigate with our supposed Patient Zero, however, we'd need him here. And I'm scared to see what's become of Sniper.
> 
> While I slept, Doc spent the day observin' Demo—well, just Demo's head, which appeared on one of the cameras. His body—nowhere to be found. I can't help but feel in my bones, I'm going to need to keep a good eye on that head. It'll tell me what I need to know about his body, whenever it does end up showing up.
> 
> Other than that... Doc asked me to keep the noise down. That he can't sleep well if he hears my sentry exploding and whatnot. But I ain't shuttin' down this whole operation just so he can get his beauty rest. I got no idea what he's getting at.
> 
> Let's just hope tonight is peaceful. Whatever peaceful means at a time like this.
> 
> *[CLICK - tape recorder stops]*

## Night 3 Recording

**Duration:** ~80 seconds  
**Tone:** Emotional weight, things getting harder

> *[CLICK - tape recorder starts]*
> 
> "Log Three. Sniper's been stationed on the Red battlements all day, locking down the sightline. We've got no chance at escaping on foot. So I set up teleporters this morning with hopes of teleporting the hell outta here. But Doc doesn't seem intent on leaving so soon. The more of our team that moseys on down across that bridge, the more blood samples he can collect for his research.
> 
> He got a sample today, but not from Sniper. Doc tried callin' out for him, but in doing so, he drew the attention of none other than Heavy. The big guy came runnin' the moment he heard Doc's voice. As if somewhere deep down, he's still remembers. Cornered, Doc took one of the teleporters back to the Intel Room right in the nick of time.
> 
> After Heavy calmed down, he began to stalk slowly towards Intel. My sentry definitely ain't stopping him—so I made lures using recordings of Medic's voice. I hope and PRAY that they can draw him away. Unfortunately, I have to teleport into the rooms to set 'em up. I'll be safe as long as I don't run into anyone. Well, except for demo's head. He doesn't bite. Least not yet.
> 
> All in all, Doc's pretty torn up about Heavy. He's getting more irritable by the day, but I need him to focus up. We're gettin' closer to a solution, I can feel it."
> 
> *[CLICK - tape recorder stops]*

## Night 4 Recording

**Duration:** ~80 seconds  
**Tone:** Sleep deprivation, paranoia, strange events

> *[CLICK - tape recorder starts]*
> 
> "Log four. I dreamt about Pyro this morning. Or more accurately, I had a nightmare. Poor fella is being subjected to whatever the hell this is, and I can't stand to think about it.
> 
> We thought we'd drawn Sniper over today. Medic stood out in the open for a second too long, and I thought he was a goner, but Sniper didn't shoot. In fact, he simply began to make his way over to us. Medic thought that this was it, that we would get the sample we needed.
> 
> It turned out to be Spy, wearing his face. His disguise was top-notch. He didn't attack us, though... he seemed to just want to mess with us, the darn saboteur that he is. Or maybe he thinks he's too refined to get our blood on his knife.
> 
> The fact that he's now around means I'll have to keep an eye on my sentry. Just because he's lost his mind doesn't mean he's forgotten how to use that damn sapper of his.
> 
> Right before I went down to intel tonight, Sniper—the real Sniper—zipped over to Blu Fort. As if he teleported using a bullet. At least he's over here now. So tonight, Doc'll get some rest, and I'll keep us safe. And when he wakes up tomorrow, we can get the sample we need from Sniper. And then we can end this all.
> 
> One more day, Doc told me through gritted teeth. He's clearly approaching his breaking point. One more damn day.
> 
> *[CLICK - tape recorder stops]*

## Night 5 Recording

**Duration:** ~75 seconds  
**Tone:** Desperate hope, pushing through

> *[CLICK - tape recorder starts]*
> 
> "Log five. Pyro's here.
> 
> It's not like I saw him. But I looked out at Red Base this morning and saw it was in flames. Destroyed.
> 
> So now we're hunkering down real hard in Blu Intel. We can't leave, can't nothing, because all our friends have come down to greet us.
> 
> Pyro didn't show up on any of the cameras, but I know he's here. I can hear him in rooms. I don't know what this virus did to him. I don't think I want to know.
> 
> But Doc's figured something out. He got a sample of Sniper's blood, and came to the conclusion that the virus wasn't just somethin' Sniper randomly caught. Rather, it's somethin' Blu team synthesized. Somethin' the Administrator likely had them cook up, before she had them pack up and leave. Meaning the cure's been here the whole damn time. Right here in Intel.
> 
> So, Medic's staying up tonight. But he isn't looking so hot. Looks like he just might lose it. But I had to reassure him—one more night. That's all he needs. One night to finish the compound.
> 
> I'll keep him safe. And I'll get everyone back.
> 
> Just one. More. Night.
> 
> *[CLICK - tape recorder stops]*

## Night 6 Monologue (Bad Ending Path)

**Duration:** ~40 seconds  
**Tone:** Devastation, grim determination  
**Note:** This is NOT a recording - Engineer speaks live at the start of Night 6. No tape clicks. Raw and immediate.

> "Doc's gone.
> 
> He couldn't take it anymore. The sentry fire, the explosions, night after night after night. He just... walked out. Gave himself over to them.
> 
> He's one of them now.
> 
> Don't know how long I can hold out. Maybe when I'm dead and gone, someone will come down and listen to these.
> 
> But I sure as hell ain't going quietly. I'll make it loud. I'll make 'em work for every damned inch."

## Night 6 Recording (Good Ending Path)

**Duration:** ~55 seconds  
**Tone:** Exhausted triumph, bittersweet relief

> *[CLICK - tape recorder starts]*
> 
> "Log six. Final log.
> 
> Doc did it. Crazy son of a gun actually did it.
> 
> Loaded the compound into the sentry shells. Every shot's a dose now. Took all night, but... they're wakin' up. One by one.
> 
> Scout don't remember nothin'. Soldier thinks he just had a bad dream. Heavy... Heavy cried. First thing he did when he came to.
> 
> *[pause]*
> 
> Turns out the virus wasn't an accident. Administrator had Blu's Medic cook it up — some kinda test. Sniper was the carrier. Never got his Australium shots as a baby, bein' from New Zealand and all.
> 
> We got questions. Lots of 'em. Ms. Pauling was the last one to see Sniper before he turned.
> 
> *[sound of footsteps, others talking in background]*
> 
> But that's tomorrow's problem. Right now... right now we rest.
> 
> Engineer, signin' off.
> 
> *[CLICK - tape recorder stops]*

## Medic's Research Notes (Optional Collectibles)

These could be shorter recordings or text logs found by teleporting to specific rooms:

### Sample Log - Heavy's Room
> "Subject: Heavy Weapons Guy. Motor function: 95%. Aggression: Suppressed. Responds to familiar voices. Hypothesis: Emotional memory persists despite neural degradation. He... he still knows me."

### Sample Log - Sniper's Position  
> "Patient Zero identified. Sniper's bloodwork shows earliest mutation markers. Timeline correlates with Administrator's mission. This was not an accident."

### Sample Log - Demoman Analysis
> "The Eyelander exhibits... impossible properties. Spatial displacement. The blade doesn't cut flesh—it cuts *reality*. Head maintains awareness independent of body. Recommend extreme caution."
